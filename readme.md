## Additional Information

### How It Works

The Virtual Whiteboard uses advanced computer vision techniques to recognize hand movements and gestures. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the core functionalities:

1. **Hand Tracking**: The application employs MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking. This allows it to detect the position and movement of your hands.
2. **Gesture Recognition**: Specific gestures trigger actions such as selecting tools, changing colors, or saving drawings. The application learns and adapts to your unique gestures.
3. **Drawing Mechanics**: OpenCV processes the visual input to render your drawings accurately on the screen.

### Development Roadmap

We have exciting plans for the future of the Virtual Whiteboard. Here are some features we aim to implement:

- **Voice Commands**: Allow users to control the application using voice.
- **Multi-User Support**: Enable collaborative drawing sessions with multiple users.
- **Enhanced Object Detection**: Improve the tracking of various objects for more interactive features.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Develop a mobile version of the application for touch-enabled devices.

### Community Feedback

We value community feedback. If you have suggestions or encounter issues, please create an issue in the GitHub repository. Your input helps us improve the application.

### Showcase Your Work
